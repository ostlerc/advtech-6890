/**
 * CS 6890 Spring 2015, Problem Set 3.
 * 
 * Suppose you have a rectangular board with blocks that can
 * only move horizontally and blocks that can only move
 * vertically. This board is represented by a 2D array of 
 * characters where 'H' and 'V' represent horizontal and
 * vertical blocks, respectively, and where '.' represents
 * an empty space (there is no 'T' block and you can assume
 * the board is correctly setup).
 * 
 * Implement the countConfigs method below to count the number
 * of configurations reachable on a board with horizontal blocks
 * and vertical blocks, using any number of moves.
 * 
 * Breath first search (BFS) or depth first search (DFS) are
 * both possible algorithms for solving this problem.
 * 
 * @version Sat, Feb 21, 2015
